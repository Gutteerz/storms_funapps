Welcome to my bogosort implementasion, this is a program made just for fun with no real world usecases.

This code is a modified version of the geeksforgeeks implementasion, wich I changed to print out the current
tries and the total tries it uses before getting it

The time complexity is in worst case O(INF) and in best case O(1) so it is an interesting algorithm.
